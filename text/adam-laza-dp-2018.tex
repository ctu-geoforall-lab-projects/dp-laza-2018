  %% ML: implementations ?
  This master thesis is dedicated to a process isolation in PyWPS
  framework as one of the OGC WPS implementation. OGC WPS is Web
  Processing Service Standard defined by Open Geospatial Consortium.

The first part describes the standard itself including all three mandatory operations
\textit{GetCapabilities}, \textit{DescribeProcess} and \textit{Execute}. At the end of the first part some implementations of the standard
are mentioned.

The second part concentrates on \textit{PyWPS}, one of the WPS
%% ML: implementations ?
implementation written in Python. Readers are introduced to the
current state of PyWPS as well as to \textit{PyWPS-demo} project, a
demo server instance, which the implementation part is based on. A
research about possible solutions of process isolation follows and
then \textit{Docker} technology is described as final choice for
implementaion.

The third part covers the implementation of Docker containers for process isolation. The workflow of \textit{Execute} operation is
described in detail and brand new \textit{Container} class with all its methods is introduced.

\necislovana{Introduction} 
With the huge progress of technologies, our society is becoming more and more digitalized and the amount of various data 
is getting bigger and bigger. There are data all around us and demand for applications or services based on the data is
growing. However, the data in its raw form may not be sufficient to make a conclusion. More often the data need to be 
processed and used as inputs data for some kind of analyses. With increasing number of gathered data such as
satellite images or remotely sensed data, any manual processing is almost inconceivable. The data processing needs to
be done in a systematic and fully-automized way.

Therefore, in order to be able to process data independently of the type of acquisition, format or platform, 
international standard interfaces and standardized frameworks are necessary. The Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. 
(OGC), an organization oriented toward open geospatial standards, researches and establishes technical standards for 
data compatibility and interoperability technical standards. Besides quite famous and used standards as WMS and WFS, 
there exists the WPS standard. The WPS standard defines an interface that facilitates the publishing of geospatial 
processes. It provides rules how inputs and outputs are handled. The WPS is only a standard and there are several 
implementations. This work is primarily focused on the \textit{PyWPS} framework.

\bigskip
The main topic of this thesis is process isolation in PyWPS framework. A process is just some geospatial operation which 
has its defined inputs and outputs and which is deployed on a server. The server is able to execute multiple 
processes at the same time. This thesis deals with the isolation of individual processes, especially for security and 
performance reasons. With every process fully isolated, so they cannot interact with each other, the higher security 
level is ensured.

The thesis is composed of several parts. The first part describes the WPS standard, its operations 
\textit{GetCapabilities}, \textit{DescribeProcess} and \textit{Execute} and inputs and outputs structures. A quick
overview of some implementations of WPS standard follows and brings a basic information about them.

Nevertheless, this work is dedicated to PyWPS, an implementation in Python. In the second part, its current state
is described as well as \textit{pywps-demo} - a side project providing demo server instance - which the practical
part is based on. A research comes after that and covers various projects and technologies which were considered
as a solution for process isolation. Eventually, the Docker technology is chosen for the implementation part.
Docker has been selected as one of the most used technology for containerization. It puts every process into a separate
container so the isolation is ensured. Moreover, Docker provides a mechanism to pause, stop and start a container so it
looks like a possible solution for the future WPS 2.0.0 standard implementation which requires this functionality. Using
Docker, it also opens new possibilities, e. g. being able to deploy running job to cloud.

The third part describes the implementation. It explains the Execute operation workflow, a process execution and how the Docker containers are used for the PyWPS process isolation. New \textit{Container} class, which were developed during
the work on this thesis, is introduced as well as its methods.

\necislovana{Conclusion}
The goal of the thesis was to find and implement a solution for process isolation in \textit{PyWPS}. This functionality was 
demanded by PyWPS developers who would appreciate the possibility to isolate each process execution. With every process 
fully isolated, a higher level of security is ensured. Moreover, without the isolation the processes have access to a 
file-system of a hosting OS.

But there are other reasons considered. One of them is a performance. Non-isolated processes share the resources
of a host machine. In case that a client requests an execution of a process that is poorly designed, its execution
can consume a lot of resources and thus it may slow down other process executions running in parallel. In the 
worst-case scenario a process execution can bring down the server.

In the first part, the thesis sets a theoretical background and explain the \textit{WPS} standard. Some project which implement 
the standard are mentioned. Second part is dedicated to \textit{PyWPS} as a Python implementation of the WPS. There is described 
the currentstate of the project followed by a research.

The reseach covers various solution for the process isolation. The functionality for the isolation was the main
criterion, however beside that the selected solution should provide some mechanisms to control the execution of the
process. These mechanisms will be necessary for implementation of the WPS 2.0.0 standard.

The \textit{Docker} Container Extension has been on the developers whislist for a long time. The container encapsulates the
process execution and also offers methods to start, pause, stop or kill the container and thus the execution. Moreover
using Docker opens possibilities of Web Processing Service in a cloud computing infrastructure.

The architecture is based on \textit{pywps-demo} project. It offers a demo server instance of PyWPS. When a process
execution is requested, a server creates a Docker container with the demo server instance running inside. The request
is forwarded into the container. The process execution runs inside the container but the container output directory is 
mounted into the server file-system so the results are available on the server.

\newpage
At the time of submitting, the implementation is not finished. It provides working solution but there are
several issues to be considered. First of all, the solution does not provide an asynchronous execution. A client
receives an execute response that the process was accepted, after the execution is already finished.

Another problem is a management of containers. In the current state, a container is stopped and removed after
a successful process execution, however it is achieved with the \textit{\_dirty\_clean()} method which is
inappropriate for production environment.

Another problem is cumulation of processes on a server. These pseudo-running processes remain on the server
and block other processes even though a client has already received the results. There is missing connection
between a container and a server when a process execution inside the container is done.

All these issues prevents from integration the Docker container extension into the official PyWPS repository.
Nevertheless, I would like to continue on the development and solve all problems so I can make a pull request
at least into PyWPS develop branch. During the implementation I have contributed into 
\textit{pywps}\footnote{My \textit{pywps} GitHub repository: \url{https://github.com/lazaa32/pywps}}, 
\textit{pywps-demo}\footnote{My \textit{pywps-demo} GitHub repository: \url{https://github.com/lazaa32/pywps-flask}} and 
\textit{OWSLib}\footnote{My \textit{OWSLib} GitHub repository: \url{https://github.com/lazaa32/OWSLib}}
 projects. Pull requests into \textit{pywps} and \textit{pywps-demo} wait for the
PyWPS developers feedback and problems solution mentioned above. The pull request into OWSLib is already waiting
for approval.
